#Instalation:

Clone the repository to your computer; navigate to it's folder and run `npm install`, It might need admin rights so better do `sudo npm install`

Next install gulp `sudo npm install gulp` and that's it, all dependencies are installed.

#workflow:

In the terminal run `gulp` this will do a series of operations like, compiling LESS and JADE code, lint and jshint for javascript. In the gulp.js file you have all the automatic tasks, read about it : [gulp.js](http://www.gulpjs.com) to understand what happens in there.

The livereload allows you to see the website changing as you write the code, which is pretty cool.

Have fun with it !
